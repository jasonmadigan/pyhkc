# HKC Alarm API Python Wrapper

Python module for interacting with HKC's Alarm API, allowing for easy interactions with the alarm system.

**Note**: This uses a private API, which means it is subject to change without notice and can break at any time. Always be cautious and respectful when using private APIs. To mimic the behavior of the app and reduce the chance of being rate-limited or blocked, it is recommended to limit requests to the API to one every 5-10 seconds, especially when fetching logs or inputs, similar to HKC's new v2 App.

## Features

- Retrieve system status.
- Fetch all inputs.
- View recent logs.
- Arm and disarm the alarm in various modes.
